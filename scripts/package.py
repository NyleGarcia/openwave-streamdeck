"""Build the release archive OpenDeck installs from.

The zip contains the dev.openwave.sdPlugin directory at its root, which is what
OpenDeck's installer expects: it extracts straight into the plugins directory,
so a zip of the directory's *contents* silently installs a broken plugin with
no manifest where one is expected.

Written with zipfile rather than the zip command: the plugin is stdlib-only
Python and the release should build on a machine that has nothing else, which
a missing zip binary would otherwise be the one exception to.
