"""Write a release version into the plugin manifest.

The manifest is the only place a version means anything -- it is what OpenDeck
shows and what a user reads when reporting a bug -- so semantic-release writes
it there rather than only tagging the repository. Edited as text rather than
re-serialised so the diff is one line and the file's formatting survives.
